## ✍️ Author's Note

My programming skills aren't very good, which you can probably tell from the source code 😅.  
This project started in **May 2024**, and it was my first time developing for Android.  
I learned while building, facing many challenges and solving a lot of bugs along the way.  
Turning the ideas in my head into a working app was really exciting and fun.  
I hope it can help you too :)
